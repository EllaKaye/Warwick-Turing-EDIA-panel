## (Part of) the problem

![From [What do we know about DEI in the RSE community?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fegmVl5GnP4), a talk given by Neil Chue Hong at the Lorentz Center workshop "Vive la Differénce - RSEs", based on the paper [Understanding Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Challenges Within the Research Software Community](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01712.pdf).](diversity-percentages.png)

## Why it matters 
:::{.smaller90}
Research software typically depends on community involvement for innovation and sustainability. Improved DEI would contribute to expanding the pool of research software contributors, with benefits including:

- Increasing innovation: research has found that diverse teams can improve scientific outputs

- Increasing sustainability: Community engagement is a key part of sustainability, and the open source software community faces challenges in improving DEI

- Decreased duplication of effort and increased reuse of outputs: A stronger, more inclusive community is more likely to work together than to compete
